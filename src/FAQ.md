## What to do if an npm package isn't written in typescript?

1. Most serious libraries, while written in JS provide an index definition file. Definition files are just a list of types with no logic in them.
2. We look in the main repo of `@types`: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
3. If it's not that hard we can declare our own types

## Where to ask if I have TypeScript questions?

1. First you should ask in #dev in the Cult of Coders Slack Team
2. Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/, some problems are very specific and it's hard to find them, the guys lurking there are helpful and smart
3. Stack overflow, ofcourse
